Some things I would improve in the current version of the code:
* improve CSS organisation by using a CSS methodology
* add timepickers for both date and time selectors
* figure out the issue with 'Save event' and 'Add' buttons in Firefox
* create my own font to reduce load time instead of using font awesome's font
* improve form resetting and initial value setting

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
